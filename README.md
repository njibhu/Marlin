# Marlin configurations

This fork of Marlin is where I store my personal marlin configurations on various branches.

- Master only contains a readme to explain the content of that repository
- 2.0.x is a mirror of Marlinfw/Marlin
- bugfix-2.0.x is a mirror of Marlinfw/Marlin
- 3d-printer is my personal configuration based on a SKR Pro 1.1 bowden
- cnc is my personal configuration based on a SKR 1.4turbo
- stable-cnc is identical to cnc but based on the 2.0.x release branch
